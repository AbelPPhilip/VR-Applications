The VR Coingame is the first VR compatible application that I created. 
With majority of the coding done in Javascript, a web-based game engine (PlayCanvas) was utilized. 
If you would like to test out the game, 
- You can request a VideoWalkThrough or,
- You can create a free PlayCanvas Account and request Collaborator access
